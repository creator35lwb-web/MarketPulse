2.  **Source Attribution:** All AI-generated summaries include links to original news sources.
3.  **No Automated Trading:** The system is NOT connected to trading APIs. Human review is required for all decisions.
4.  **Infrastructure Transparency:** Documentation clearly states that free hosting is promotional and may change.
